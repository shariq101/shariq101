### Shariq Ansari's Github Page ðŸ‘‹

Hi, My name is Shariq Ansari, I am currently working as Data Engineer. I love Integrating Data from various sources and running various Analysis on them.
I am excited about how we can collect Healthcare data and help consumers make good life choices in Real-time.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Deep Learning Models
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RNN

Apart from the world of tech, I like reading philosphy specially Lingustics and etymologics, which helps me understand NLP with a unique perspective.

In my free time, I also love to read fictions from great minds like Dostoevsky etc and I like watching movies. Big fan of David Lynch.
